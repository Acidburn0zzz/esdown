== TODO ==

- Classes: Correct the super implementation:

  - Make super repect changes to an object's prototype
  - Make super work correctly in static functions (should refer to the
    prototype of the constructor, I think).

- Classes: Make sure that constructors for classes without an explicit
  constructor also get the correct name.
