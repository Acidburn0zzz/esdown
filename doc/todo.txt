- Classes: Correct the super implementation:

  - Make super repect changes to an object's prototype
  - Make super work correctly in static functions (should refer to the
    prototype of the constructor, I think).
  
  We can do this by passing in a "__super" function instead of an object.
  That function would just do a prototype lookup for the class prototype.
  
  var proto = Object.create(parent);
  var __super = prop => Object.getPrototypeOf(proto)[prop];
  
  Since we are futzing with core runtime stuff, we need to be really careful.
  We also need to take care that we are not incurring a performance regression
  or creating unwanted dependencies on ES5.

- Classes: Make sure that constructors for classes without an explicit
  constructor also get the correct name.
