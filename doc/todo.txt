== TODO ==

[M] We add a name to the constructor function for classes, but that is
    actually incorrect for class declarations.  The binding should only
    exist at the outer scope and it should be mutable.  Question is: what
    is more important, function.name, or those binding semantics?  It
    turns out that Function.name is pretty damn important.  Name is frozen
    so there's no way to set it at runtime.
[M] Add list of features and caveats to README.
[L] Arrow functions should close over arguments, too.
[L] Should we add "use strict" to class translations?  We only translate
    modules now, so classes are always strict anyway.
