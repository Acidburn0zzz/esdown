=== Overview ===

es6now is an ES6 to ES3/5 compiler.  It will translate some ECMAScript 6 
features, fairly accurately, for use in Node and browsers.  The emphasis 
here is not on completeness.  The goal is to take advantage of important 
ES6 features while still retaining transparent debuggability, using 
straightforward source transformations.

=== Instructions ===

Put build/* in your path and smoke it.  NPM not required.  You'll need 
Node.js 0.11 or later for everything to work right.

Start a REPL by running it without any arguments:

    you$ es6now

Execute a module by adding a path:

    you$ es6now main.js

Translate a module by using a hyphen:

    you$ es6now - src/main.js build/es6now.js -b -r

    --input, -i  (1)    The file to translate.
    --output, -o (2)    The file to write to.  If not set, then the output
                        will be written to the console.
    --bundle, -b        If preset, module dependencies will be bundled 
                        together in the output.
    --runtime, -r       If present, the es6now runtime code will be bundled 
                        with the output.
    --global, -g        If present, the name of the global variable to dump
                        this module's exports into.
