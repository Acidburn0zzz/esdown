== es6now ==

A quick and dirty ES6 to ES3/5 transpiler.

=== Instructions ===

Put build/* in your path and smoke it.

Start a REPL by running it without any arguments:

    you$ es6now

Execute a module by adding a path:

    you$ es6now main.js

Translate a module by using a hyphen:

    you$ es6now - src/main.js build/es6now.js -b -r
